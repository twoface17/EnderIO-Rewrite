# Ender IO - Tinkers Construct
Ender IO is a full-featured tech mod. It has armor, tools, weapons, machines, conduits, inventory management, mobs, etc.

**Attention!** This module is to be used for modular installations of Ender IO. Most people will want to install the [monolithic version](https://modrinth.com/mod/enderio) instead.

## 1.18+
Ender IO is being rewritten from the ground up for 1.18 and upward.
Alpha builds will be posted to these pages as they are ready.
Some modules may appear after others.

## Features
This is the module that contains the Tinkers Construct integration. It includes:
- Smeltery support for all Ender IO alloys
- Casting support for many Ender IO recipes
- Tool part support for all Ender IO alloys
- Modifiers and traits

If installed modularly, the base module is required.
