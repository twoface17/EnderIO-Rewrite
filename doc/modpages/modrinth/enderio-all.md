# Ender IO
Ender IO is a full-featured tech mod. It has armor, tools, weapons, machines, conduits, inventory management, mobs, etc.

**Note:** This is the monolithic installation of Ender IO, meaning that all core parts of Ender IO are all in one jar file. If you'd prefer certain modules, you can install [individual modules](https://modrinth.com/mod/enderio-base) instead.

## 1.18+
Ender IO is being rewritten from the ground up for 1.18 and upward.
Alpha builds will be posted to these pages as they are ready.
Some modules may appear after others.
